      <h2><a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> is a toolkit for
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) whose goals include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A powerful &quot;pointcut&quot; language for specifying where to apply
aspects, comparable to the pointcut language in AspectJ for Java.

</li>
<li>Management of concurrent aspects (i.e., those acting on the same &quot;join
points&quot;).

</li>
<li>Adding and removing aspects dynamically.

</li>
<li>A user-friendly DSL.

</li>
<li>Support for advising Java types through JRuby.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Is an AOP Framework Useful in Ruby?</h3>
<p>
Ruby&#8216;s metaprogramming facilities already provide some of the
capabilities for which static-language AOP toolkits like AspectJ are
typically used. With Ruby, you can easily add new methods and attributes to
existing classes and objects. You can alias and redefine existing methods,
which provides the method interception and &quot;wrapping&quot; needed to
extend or modify existing behavior.
</p>
<p>
However, what is missing in Ruby is an expressive language for describing
systemic modifications, a so-called &quot;pointcut language&quot;. If you
have simple needs for method interception and wrapping, then <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> will be overkill. However, if
you have system-wide concerns that cross the boundaries of many objects,
then an AOP tookit like <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> can
help you implement these concerns in a more modular way.
</p>
<p>
So, if you are designing with aspects, wouldn&#8216;t you like to write
your code using the same &quot;language&quot;? Without AOP support, you
have to map your aspect designs to metaprogramming idioms, which will often
be slower to implement and harder to maintain. Imagine writing objects
without native support for OOP!
</p>
<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>
Several terms are used in the AOP community.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Join Point - A point of execution in a program where &quot;advice&quot;
might be invoked.

</li>
<li>Pointcut - (yes, one word&#8230;) A set of join points of particular
interest, like a query over all join points in the system.

</li>
<li>Advice - The behavior invoked at a join point. There are several kinds of
advice:

<ul>
<li>Before advice - Advice invoked before the actual join point is invoked.

</li>
<li>After returning advice - Advice invoked after the join point executes
successfully.

</li>
<li>After raising advice - Advice invoked only after the join point raises an
exception.

</li>
<li>After advice - Advice invoked after the join point executes successfully or
raises an exception.

</li>
<li>Around advice - Advice invoked instead of the join point. The around advice
must choose whether or not to invoke the join point by calling a special
&quot;proceed&quot; method. Otherwise, the join point is NOT executed.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Only around advice can prevent execution of the join point, except for the
special case where before advice raises an exception.
</p>
<h3>Known Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>You cannot advice &quot;<a href="../classes/String.html">String</a>&quot;,
&quot;<a href="../classes/Symbol.html">Symbol</a>&quot; or instances there
of, because trying to specify either one will be confused with naming a
type.

</li>
<li>Concurrent advice on type AND advice on objects of the type can&#8216;t be
removed cleanly.

</li>
<li>The pointcut language is still limited, compared to AspectJ&#8216;s. See
also the comparison with AspectJ behavior next.

</li>
<li>The API and wrapper DSL will probably evolve until the 1.0.0 release.
Backwards compatibility will be maintained between releases as much as
possible. When it is necessary to break backwards compatibility,
translation tools will be provided, if possible.

</li>
<li>There are limitations when advising Java types through JRuby. The separate
RSpec suite in the &quot;jruby&quot; directory documentations the details
on how to use <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> with
JRuby-wrapped Java types and the limitations thereof. Here we summarize
what works and what doesn&#8216;t:

<ul>
<li><a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> advice on a method in a
Java type will only be invoked when the method is called directly from
Ruby.

</li>
<li>To have the advice invoked when the method is called from either Java or
Ruby, it is necessary to create a subclass of the Java type in Ruby and an
override of the method, which can just call &quot;super&quot;. Note that it
will be necessary for instances of this Ruby type to be used throughout,
not instances of a Java parent type.

</li>
<li>BUG 18325: If you have Ruby subclasses of Java types <b>and</b> you advise
a Java method in the hierarchy using @:types_and_descendents =&gt;
MyJavaBaseClassOrInterface@ <b>and</b> you call unadvise on the aspect, the
advice &quot;infrastructure&quot; is not correctly removed from the Ruby
types. Workaround: Only advise methods in Ruby subclasses of Java types
where the method is explicitly overridden in the Ruby class. (The spec and
the &quot;Rubyforge bug report&quot;:<a
href="http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=18325&group_id=4281&atid=16494">rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=18325&group_id=4281&atid=16494</a>
provide examples.)

</li>
<li>BUG 18326: Normally, you can use either Java- or Ruby-style method names
(e.g., &quot;doSomething&quot; vs. &quot;do_something&quot;), for Java
types. However, if you write an aspect using the Java-style for a method
name and a Ruby subclass of the Java type where the method is actually
defined (i.e., the Ruby class doesn&#8216;t override the method), it
appears that the JoinPoint was advised, but the advice is never called.
Workaround: Use the Ruby-style name in this scenario.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Differences With Other Ruby AOP Toolkits</h3>
<p>
There are several other AOP toolkits for Ruby that precede <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>. The most notable are AspectR
and the aspect capabilities in the Facets toolkit. There are also Ruby 2.0
proposals to add method wrappers for &quot;before&quot;, &quot;after&quot;
and &quot;wrap&quot; behavior.
</p>
<p>
The goal of <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> is to provide a
superset of the functionality provided by these other toolkits. <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> is suitable for non-trivial
and large-scale aspect-oriented components in systems. <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> will be most valuable for
systems where aspects might be added and removed dynamically at runtime and
systems where nontrivial pointcut descriptions are needed, requiring a
full-featured pointcut language (as discussed above&#8230;). For less
demanding needs, the alternatives are lighter weight and hence may be more
appropriate.
</p>
<h3>Differences With AspectJ Behavior</h3>
<p>
Many of AspectJ&#8216;s features are not currently supported by <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>, but some of them are planned
for future releases.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Attribute reading and writing join points are not supported. The
:attributes and :attributes_options parameters (and their synonyms) for
Aspect.new are actually &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; for the corresponding
accessor methods.

</li>
<li>More advanced AspectJ pointcut language features are not supported, such as
the runtime pointcut designators like &quot;if&quot; conditionals and
&quot;cflow&quot; (context flow) and the compile time &quot;within&quot;
and &quot;withincode&quot; designators. Most of AspectJ pointcut language
features are planned, however.

</li>
<li>While AspectJ provides &quot;intertype declaration&quot; capabilities
(i.e., adding state and behavior to existing classes), Ruby&#8216;s native
metaprogramming support satisfies this need. There may be convenience hooks
added in a future release, however.

</li>
<li>User defined advice precedence is not supported. However, advice precedence
is unambiguous; the last aspects created while modules are loaded at
runtime have higher precedence than earlier aspects. Ensuring a particular
order is not always easy, of course.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
However, <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> does have a few
advantages over AspectJ, especially when advising Java types when running
in JRuby.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> can add and remove advice
dynamically, at runtime.

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> can advise individual
objects, not just classes.

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> can advise JDK classes.
AspectJ can also do this, but not by default.

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> supports named advice that
can be defined separately from the aspects that use the advice.

</li>
<li><a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> can advise ancestor
(parent) types, not just derived (descendent) types of specified types.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note: at the time of this writing (V0.4.0 release), there is an important
limitation of <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> when used
with java code; it appears that advice is only invoked if an advised method
is called directly from Ruby code. If the advised method is called by other
Java code, the advice is <b>not</b> invoked. Whether or not this limitation
can be removed is under investigation.
</p>
<p>
Also, as of V0.4.0, the interaction behavior of <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> and AspectJ or Spring aspects
has not been investigated.
</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>
Several complete examples are provided in the &quot;examples&quot;
directory.
</p>
<p>
In most cases, you can either declare the appropriate classes or use the
optional DSL, which adds convenience methods to classes, objects, or even
<a href="../classes/Object.html">Object</a> itself. The API also supports
many synonyms for things like types, objects, and methods. The best place
to see the full list of synonyms is the output of
&quot;pointcut_spec.rb&quot;.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example that traces invocations of all public instance methods
(included inherited ones) of the classes or modules Foo and Bar.
</p>
<pre>
        require 'aquarium'
        Aspect.new :around, :calls_to =&gt; :all_methods, :on_types =&gt; [Foo, Bar] do |join_point, object, *args|
                p &quot;Entering: #{join_point.target_type.name}##{join_point.method_name} for object #{object}&quot;
                result = join_point.proceed
                p &quot;Leaving: #{join_point.target_type.name}##{join_point.method_name} for object #{object}&quot;
                result  # block needs to return the result of the &quot;proceed&quot;!
        end
</pre>
<p>
The advice to execute at each join point is the block. The pointcut is the
set of all public instance methods in Foo and Bar. (There are additional
options available for specifying class methods, protected methods,
excluding inherited (ancestor) methods, etc.) Here is the same example
using the convenience DSL that adds aspect methods to <a
href="../classes/Object.html">Object</a> (available only if you require
aquarium/aspects/dsl/object_dsl&#8217;, since other toolkits, like Rails,
define similar methods on <a href="../classes/Object.html">Object</a>!).
</p>
<pre>
        require 'aquarium/aspects/dsl/object_dsl'
        around :calls_to =&gt; :all_methods, :on_types =&gt; [Foo, Bar] do |join_point, object, *args|
                p &quot;Entering: #{join_point.target_type.name}##{join_point.method_name} for object #{object}&quot;
                result = join_point.proceed
                p &quot;Leaving: #{join_point.target_type.name}##{join_point.method_name} for object #{object}&quot;
                result  # block needs to return the result of the &quot;proceed&quot;!
        end
</pre>
<p>
See &quot;examples/method_tracing_example.rb&quot; for a more detailed
version of this example.
</p>
<p>
If you don&#8216;t want to add these methods to <a
href="../classes/Object.html">Object</a>, you can also add them
individually to modules, classes, or objects:
</p>
<pre>
        require 'aquarium/aspects/dsl/aspect_dsl'  # NOT object_dsl
        ...
        module MyModule
                include Aquarium::Aspects::DSL::AspectDSL
        end

        class MyClass
                include Aquarium::Aspects::DSL::AspectDSL
        end

        my_object = MyOtherClass.new
        my_object.extend (Aquarium::Aspects::DSL::AspectDSL)
</pre>
<p>
If you use the DSL inside a class and omit the :type(s) and :object(s)
options, &quot;self&quot; is assumed.
</p>
<pre>
        class Foo
                include Aquarium::Aspects::DSL::AspectDSL
                ...
                def critical_operation *args
                        ...
                end
        end
        ...
        class Foo
                around :critical_operation do |join_point, object, *args|
                        p &quot;Entering: Foo#critical_operation&quot;
                        result = join_point.proceed
                        p &quot;Leaving: Foo#critical_operation&quot;
                        result
                end
        end
</pre>
<p>
It is important to note that aspect &quot;instances&quot; usually behave
like class (static) variables, in terms of the lifetime of their effects.
In the example shown, class Foo is permanently modified to do the print
statements shown for all &quot;critical methods&quot;, unless you save the
result of calling &quot;around&quot; to a variable, e.g.,
critical_operation_logging, and you explicitly call
&quot;critical_operation_logging.unadvise&quot; at some future time. Put
another way, the effects scope just like changes made when you reopen a
class or module.
</p>
<p>
A common mistake is to create an aspect in an initialize method and assign
it to an attribute. This usually means that you are creating long-lived,
redundant aspects every time an instance of your class is created. The
aspect modifications remain in effect even when the instances themselves
are garbage collected!
</p>
<p>
Here are some more succinct examples, illustrating the API (using the DSL
methods) and some of the various synonyms for methods, types, etc.
</p>
<p>
You can pass in pointcuts defined elsewhere:
</p>
<pre>
        my_pointcut = Pointcut.new :invocations_of =&gt; /^do_/, :within_types =&gt; /Foo::Bar::/
        around :pointcuts =&gt; my_pointcut do |jp, obj, *args| ...         # Pass in a pointcut
        around :pointcuts =&gt; [my_pointcut, ...] do |jp, obj, *args| ...  # Pass in a pointcut array
</pre>
<p>
As a convenience, since a JoinPoint is like a Pointcut with one element,
you can pass a JoinPoint object where Pointcut objects are expected:
</p>
<p>
my_join_point1 = JoinPoint.new :type =&gt; Foo::Bar, :method =&gt; do_this
my_join_point2 = JoinPoint.new :type =&gt; Foo::Bar, :method =&gt; do_that
around :pointcuts =&gt; my_join_point1 do |jp, obj, *args| &#8230; around
:pointcuts =&gt; [my_join_point1, my_join_point2, &#8230;] do |jp, obj,
*args| &#8230;
</p>
<p>
You can specify a single type, a type name, a type regular expression, or
an array of the same. Note that :type and :types are synonymous. Use the
singular form for better readability when you are specifying just one type.
Other synonyms include :on_types, :within_types, and :in_types, plus the
singular forms.
</p>
<pre>
        around :type = A, ...
        around :type = &quot;A&quot;, ...
        around :types =&gt; [A, B, ...], ...
        around :types =&gt; %w[A, B, ...], ...
        around :types =&gt; /A::.*Helper$/, ...
        around :types =&gt; [/A::.*Helper$/, /B::Foo.*/], ...
</pre>
<p>
Everywhere &quot;type&quot; is used, you can substitute &quot;class&quot;,
&quot;classes&quot;, &quot;module&quot;, or &quot;modules&quot;. Note that
they are treated as synonyms; there is currently no enforcement that the
values passed with &quot;:class&quot;, for example, are actually classes,
not modules.
</p>
<p>
Using the plural versions of the synonyms with method specifications
sometimes read better:
</p>
<pre>
        around :calls_to =&gt; :all_methods, :on_types =&gt; [A, B, ...], ...
        around :calls_to =&gt; :all_methods, :in_types =&gt; [A, B, ...], ...
        around :calls_to =&gt; :all_methods, :within_types =&gt; [A, B, ...], ...
</pre>
<p>
You can specify types and their descendents (subclasses or included
modules) or ancestors. The same synonym prefixes for :types and :type also
apply.
</p>
<pre>
        around :type_and_ancestors = A, ...
        around :types_and_ancestors = A, ...
        around :type_and_descendents = A, ...
        around :types_and_descendents = A, ...
        around :classes_and_descendents = A, ...
        around :modules_and_descendents = A, ...
</pre>
<p>
Some of the synonyms:
</p>
<pre>
        around :calls_to =&gt; :all_methods, :on_types_and_ancestors = A, ...
        around :calls_to =&gt; :all_methods, :in_types_and_ancestors = A, ...
        around :calls_to =&gt; :all_methods, :within_types_and_ancestors = A, ...
        and similarly for descendents
</pre>
<p>
You can specify a single object or an array of objects. As for :types, you
can use :object, :objects, :on_objects, :within_object, :in_objects, and
the singular forms synonymously.
</p>
<pre>
        a1 = A.new
        a2 = A.new
        around :object = a1, ...
        around :objects =&gt; [a1, a2], ...
</pre>
<p>
Some of the synonyms:
</p>
<pre>
        around :calls_to =&gt; :all_methods, :on_objects = [a1, a2], ...
        around :calls_to =&gt; :all_methods, :in_objects = [a1, a2], ...
        around :calls_to =&gt; :all_methods, :within_objects = [a1, a2], ...
</pre>
<p>
If no types or objects are specified, the object defaults to
&quot;self&quot;. However, this default is only supported when using the
DSL to create an aspect, e.g.,
</p>
<pre>
        class MyClass
                include Aquarium::Aspects::DSL::AspectDSL
                def doit; ...; end

                around :method =&gt; doit, ...   # Implicit :object =&gt; self, i.e., MyClass
        end
</pre>
<p>
You can specify a single method symbol (name), a regular expression, or an
array of the same. The synonyms for :methods include :method, :calls_to,
:invoking, :invocations_of, and :sending_messages_to. The special keywords
:all and :all_methods mean match all methods, subject to the
:method_options discussed next.
</p>
<pre>
        around :method = :all_methods, ...
        around :method = :foo, ...
        around :methods = [:foo, :bar, :baz], ...
        around :methods = /^foo/, ...
        around :methods = [/^foo/, /bar$/], ...
</pre>
<p>
Using the synonyms:
</p>
<pre>
        around :calls_to = :all_methods, ...
        after  :invoking = :all_methods, ...
        after  :invocations_of = :all_methods, ...
        after  :sending_messages_to = :all_methods, ...
        after  :within_methods = :all_methods, ...
</pre>
<p>
You can specify method options. By default, public instance methods only
are matched. Note that :methods =&gt; :all or :all_methods with no method
options matches all public instance methods, including ancestor (inherited
and included module) methods. For all the method options (except for
:exclude_ancestor_methods), you can append the suffix &quot;_methods&quot;.
You can also use the :restrict_methods_to synonym for :method_options.
</p>
<pre>
        around :methods = /foo/, :method_options =&gt; [:instance], ...  # match instance methods (default)
        around :methods = /foo/, :method_options =&gt; [:class], ...     # match class methods
        around :methods = /foo/, :method_options =&gt; [:public, :protected, :private], ...
                # match public, protected, and private instance methods
        around :methods = /foo/, :method_options =&gt; [:singleton], ... # match singleton methods
        around :methods = /foo/, :method_options =&gt; [:exclude_ancestor_methods], ...
                # ignore methods defined in ancestors, inherited classes and included modules
</pre>
<p>
With synonyms:
</p>
<pre>
        around :calls_to = /foo/, :restricting_methods_to =&gt; [:singleton_methods], ...
</pre>
<p>
You can specify attributes, which are actually convenience methods for the
attribute accessors. They work very much like the :method options. Note
that :all is NOT supported in this case. The available synonyms are
slightly more complicated, as shown in these examples.
</p>
<pre>
        around :attribute  = :foo, ...                                 # defaults to methods #foo and #foo=
        around :attributes = :foo, ...                                 # the same
        around :accessing  = :foo, ...                                 # the same

        around :attribute = :foo, :attribute_options =&gt; [:readers]...  # only matches #foo
        around :reading   = :foo                                       # the same

        around :attribute = :foo, :attribute_options =&gt; [:writers]...  # only matches #foo=
        around :writing   = :foo                                       # the same

        around :attributes = [:foo, :bar, :baz], ...
        around :attributes = /^foo/, ...
        around :attributes = [/^foo/, /bar$/], ...
</pre>
<p>
You can specify a &quot;Pointcut&quot; that encapsulates one or more
pre-defined Pointcuts or JoinPoints.
</p>
<pre>
        around :pointcut = pc, ...                                     # for pre-defined pointcut &quot;pc&quot;
        around :pointcuts = [pc, ...], ...                             # for pre-defined pointcut list
        around :pointcut = jp, ...                                     # for pre-defined join point &quot;jp&quot;
        around :pointcuts = [jp, ...], ...                             # for pre-defined join point list
        around :pointcut = {:type =&gt; T, :method =&gt; :m}, ...            # same as around :type =&gt; T, :method =&gt; :m, ..
</pre>
<p>
Using the plural versions of the synonyms, with method specifications so
they read better:
</p>
<pre>
        around :on_pointcuts =&gt; [pc1, pc2, ...], ...
        around :in_pointcuts =&gt; [pc1, pc2, ...], ...
        around :within_pointcuts =&gt; [pc1, pc2, ...], ...
</pre>
<p>
You can specifically exclude particular pointcuts, join points, types,
objects, methods, or attributes. This is useful when you specify a list or
regular expression of &quot;items&quot; to match and you want to exclude
some of the items. Note that there is an open bug (15202) that appears to
affect advising types, unadvising the types, then advising objects of the
same types. (This is not likely to happen a lot in real applications, but
it shows up when running <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>&#8216;s specs.)
</p>
<pre>
        around ..., :exclude_pointcut = pc, ...
        around ..., :exclude_pointcuts = [pc, ...]
        around ..., :exclude_join_point = jp, ...
        around ..., :exclude_join_points = [jp, ...]
        around ..., :exclude_type = t, ...
        around ..., :exclude_types = [t, ...]
        around ..., :exclude_type_and_ancestors = t, ...
        around ..., :exclude_types_and_ancestors = [t, ...]
        around ..., :exclude_type_and_descendents = t, ...
        around ..., :exclude_types_and_descendents = [t, ...]
        around ..., :exclude_object = o, ...
        around ..., :exclude_objects = [o, ...]
        around ..., :exclude_method = m, ...
        around ..., :exclude_methods = [m, ...]
        around ..., :exclude_attribute = a, ...
        around ..., :exclude_attributes = [a, ...]
</pre>
<p>
All the same synonyms for :types, :objects, and :methods apply here as well
(after the &quot;exclude_&quot; prefix).
</p>
<p>
You can advice methods before execution:
</p>
<pre>
        before :types =&gt; ...
</pre>
<p>
You can advice methods after returning successfully (i.e., no exceptions
were raised):
</p>
<pre>
        after_returning :types =&gt; ...
        after_returning_from :types =&gt; ...     # synonym
</pre>
<p>
You can advice methods after raising exceptions:
</p>
<pre>
        after_raising :types =&gt; ...              # After any exception is thrown
        after_raising_within :types =&gt; ...       # synonym
        after_raising =&gt; MyError, :types =&gt; ...  # Only invoke advice if &quot;MyError&quot; is raised.
        after_raising =&gt; [MyError1, MyError2], :types =&gt; ...
                # Only invoke advice if &quot;MyError1&quot; or &quot;MyError2&quot; is raised.
</pre>
<p>
You can advice methods after returning successfully or raising exceptions.
(You can&#8216;t specify a set of exceptions in this case.):
</p>
<pre>
        after :types =&gt; ...
        after_raising_within_or_returning_from : types =&gt;      # synonym
</pre>
<p>
You can advice methods both before after. This is different from around
advice, where the around advice has to explicitly invoke the join point
(using JoinPoint#proceed). Instead, the before-and-after methods are
convenience wrappers around the creation of separate before advice and the
corresponding after advice.
</p>
<pre>
        before_and_after :types =&gt;, ...
        before_and_after_returning :types =&gt;, ...
        before_and_after_returning_from :types =&gt;, ... # synonym
        before_and_after_raising :types =&gt;, ...
        before_and_after_raising_within :types =&gt;, ... # synonym
        before_and_after_raising_within_or_returning_from :types =&gt;, ...       # synonym
</pre>
<p>
If you pass a block to Aspect.new, it will be the advice. When invoked, the
advice will be passed the following three arguments,
</p>
<pre>
        1) the JoinPoint, which will contain a JoinPoint::Context object with useful context information,
        2) the object being sent the current message, and
        3) the parameters passed with the original message.
</pre>
<p>
Recall that a Proc doesn&#8216;t check the number of arguments (while
lambdas do), so if you don&#8216;t care about any of the trailing
parameters, you can leave them out of the parameter list. Recall that the
other difference between the two is that a return statement in a Proc
returns from the method that contains it. As rule, do NOT use return
statements in advices!
</p>
<pre>
        around :type =&gt; [...], :methods =&gt; :all do |join_point, object, *args|
          advice_to_execute_before_the_jp
          result = join_point.proceed  # Invoke the join point, passing *args implicitly (you can override...)
          advice_to_execute_after_the_jp
          result     # return the result of the &quot;proceed&quot;, unless you override the value.
        end
        around(:type =&gt; [...], :methods =&gt; :all) {|join_point, object, *args| ...}  # (...) necessary for precedence...
</pre>
<p>
In the example, we show that you must be careful to return the correct
value, usually the value returned by &quot;proceed&quot; or a value created
by the block itself.
</p>
<p>
Note, prior to V0.2.0, the advice argument list was |join_point, *args|. <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> will look for such obsolete
signatures (by looking at the arity of the proc) and raise an exception, if
found. This check will be removed in a future release.
</p>
<p>
Rather than passing a block as the advice, you can pass a
previously-created Proc:
</p>
<pre>
        around :type =&gt; [...], :methods =&gt; :all, :advice =&gt; advice
        around :type =&gt; [...], :methods =&gt; :all, :advise_with =&gt; advice  # synonym for advice. Note the &quot;s&quot;!
        around :type =&gt; [...], :methods =&gt; :all, :call =&gt; advice         # synonym for advice.
        around :type =&gt; [...], :methods =&gt; :all, :invoke =&gt; advice       # synonym for advice.
</pre>
<p>
Finally, when running in JRuby, you can advise Java types! See the examples
in the separate RSpec suite in the &quot;jruby&quot; directory.
</p>

</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
The simplest approach is to install the gem:
</p>
<pre>
  gem install -y aquarium    # sudo may be required on non-Windows systems
</pre>
<h2>Building the <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> gem</h2>
<p>
If you prefer to build the gem locally, check out source from
svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/aquarium/trunk. Then do the following:
</p>
<pre>
  rake gem
  gem install pkg/aquarium-x.y.z.gem   # sudo may be required
</pre>
<h2>Running <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>&#8216;s RSpec Specs</h2>
<p>
In order to run <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>&#8216;s
full suite of specs (rake pre_commit) you must install the following gems
and tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li>rake # Runs the build script

</li>
<li>rspec # Used instead of Test::Unit for TDD

</li>
<li>rcov # Verifies that the code is 100% covered by specs

</li>
<li>webgen # Generates the static HTML website

</li>
<li>RedCloth # Required by webgen

</li>
<li>syntax # Required by RSpec&#8216;s custom webgen extension to highlight
ruby code

</li>
<li>diff-lcs # Required if you use the &#8212;diff switch

</li>
<li>win32console # Required by the &#8212;colour switch if you&#8216;re on
Windows

</li>
<li>meta_project # Required in order to make releases at RubyForge

</li>
<li>heckle # Required if you use the &#8212;heckle switch

</li>
<li>jruby # Required if run the separate spec suite in the &quot;jruby&quot;
directory

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once those are all installed, you should be able to run the suite with the
following steps:
</p>
<ul>
<li>svn co svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/aquarium/trunk aquarium

</li>
<li>cd aquarium

</li>
<li>rake spec

</li>
</ul>
<p>
or
</p>
<ul>
<li>rake spec_rcov # also runs rcov

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> itself - once
built - doesn&#8216;t have any dependencies outside the Ruby core and
stdlib.
</p>
<p>
If you want to run the tests for the JRuby support, you must also have
JRuby 1.1RC2 or later installed. To run the specs for JRuby, use the
command
</p>
<ul>
<li>rake verify_jruby

</li>
</ul>
<p>
This command runs the standard <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> specs using JRuby instead of
MRI, then runs a separate set of specs in the &quot;jruby/spec&quot;
directory which test <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> with
Java classes inside JRuby.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="http://aquarium.rubyforge.org">aquarium.rubyforge.org</a> for
further documentation.

My colleagues in the AOSD community, in particular those who developed
AspectJ, have been a big inspiration. The RSpec team, in particular David
Chelimsky, have really inspired my thinking about what&#8216;s possible in
Ruby, especially in the realm of DSLs. I also cribbed parts of the RSpec
Rake process ;) My colleagues at <a
href="../classes/Object.html">Object</a> Mentor are an endless source of
insight and inspiration.
