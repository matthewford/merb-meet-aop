      <h2>Updating to <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>-0.4.0</h2>
<p>
This release is fully backwards-compatible with previous releases. It
expands the API slightly and adds internal improvements to better support
JRuby. There should be no upgrade issues.
</p>
<h2>Updating to <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>-0.3.1</h2>
<p>
There should be no upgrade issues with this release. However, the
enhancement 17565 now ensures that a JoinPoint is only specified with one
type and a type that actually exists, when a string, symbol, or regex is
used to specify the type.
</p>
<h2>Updating to <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>-0.3.0</h2>
<p>
There are no known upgrade issues with this release. Although many new
synonyms were added for API method parameters, all changes are backwards
compatible.
</p>
<h2>Updating to <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>-0.2.0</h2>
<p>
This release changes the expected advice parameter list from |join_point,
*method_args| to |join_point, object, *method_args|, where
&quot;object&quot; is the current object receiving the message
corresponding to the advised join point. Therefore, when you upgrade, you
will need to modify your advices to take this extra argument, even if you
don&#8216;t use it. Since an advice of |jp, *args| would silently
&quot;absorb&quot; the object into the beginning of &quot;*args&quot;,
thereby potentially causing confusion, <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> will raise an exception if the
advice block or proc has this obsolete signature.
</p>
<p>
Note that &quot;JoinPoint#Context.advised_object&quot; is still supported,
even if it is now less useful.
</p>
<h2>Updating to <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>-0.1.8</h2>
<p>
V0.1.7 did not successfully &quot;register&quot; at rubyforge. This
releases fixes that problem and also adds several feature enhancements and
refactorings. There are no known upgrade issues.
</p>
<h2>Updating to <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>-0.1.7</h2>
<p>
This is primarily a bug-fix release, so there should be no upgrading or
incompatibility issues.
</p>
<h2>Updating to <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>-0.1.6</h2>
<p>
As described in the CHANGES, the JoinPoint#type, JoinPoint#type=,
JoinPoint#object, and JoinPoint#object= are now deprecated. Client code
that uses these methods will still work, but warning messages will be
written to STDOUT. See CHANGES for more details.
</p>
<h2>Updating to <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>-0.1.5</h2>
<p>
This is mostly a bug-fix release, but it did have to introduce one API
change, as described in the CHANGES. In particular, the aspect
&quot;DSL&quot; methods are no longer automatically to <a
href="../classes/Object.html">Object</a>, as some of their names overlap
with methods added by Rails.
</p>
<p>
Now, if you want these methods added to <a
href="../classes/Object.html">Object</a>, you must require the new
lib/aquarium/aspects/dsl/object_dsl.rb explicitly.
</p>
<p>
As an alternative, if you just want these methods added selectively in
certain types, then do the following:
</p>
<p>
&lt;ruby&gt; require &#8216;aquarium/aspects/dsl/aspect_dsl&#8216;
</p>
<p>
class MyClass # reopen &quot;MyClass&quot;
</p>
<pre>
        # Add the methods as _class_ methods
        include Aquarium::Aspects::DSL::AspectDSL
</pre>
<p>
end &lt;/ruby&gt;
</p>
<p>
or, use (class|module)_eval: &lt;ruby&gt; require
&#8216;aquarium/aspects/dsl/aspect_dsl&#8216;
</p>
<p>
MyClass.class_eval do
</p>
<pre>
        # Add the methods as _class_ methods
        include Aquarium::Aspects::DSL::AspectDSL
</pre>
<p>
end &lt;/ruby&gt;
</p>
<p>
To add the methods as <em>instance</em> methods on individual objects:
</p>
<p>
&lt;ruby&gt; object = MyClass.new object.extend(<a
href="../classes/Aquarium/Aspects/DSL/AspectDSL.html">Aquarium::Aspects::DSL::AspectDSL</a>)
&lt;/ruby&gt;
</p>
<p>
See the CHANGES for more details.
</p>
<h2>Updating existing code to <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>-0.1.0</h2>
<p>
This is the first release of <a
