      <h2>Version 0.4.0</h2>
<p>
V0.4.0 adds specs to characterize and test advising Java classes when
running on JRuby and adds several API enhancements.
</p>
<p>
Bug fixes: 17844 JRuby - Advising types, <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> thinks the type is a string
17883 Workaround for JRUBY-2089 18090 JoinPoint#invoke_original_join_point
only works with :around advice
</p>
<p>
Enhancements: 17834 Allow :class and :module (and variants) wherever :type
is allowed 17881 Add specs that exercise advising Java types and objects
using JRuby
</p>
<p>
17844 occurred because of the way JRuby encodes Java packages into modules.
<a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> now properly handles JRuby
types.
</p>
<p>
17883 reflected a JRuby bug, so a workaround was required.
</p>
<p>
17834 allows the user to substitute the words &quot;class&quot;,
&quot;classes&quot;, &quot;module&quot; or &quot;modules&quot; anywhere the
words &quot;type&quot; and &quot;types&quot; are used in the API, since
some users might naturally want to write aspects like this:
</p>
<pre>
        around :calls_to =&gt; :my_method, :in_class =&gt; MyClass do ...; end
</pre>
<p>
However, there is no enforcement to ensure that &quot;class&quot; is only
used for classes and &quot;module&quot; is only used for modules, etc.
Note: it&#8216;s possible we&#8216;ll enforce this in some future release,
as a way of saying things like &quot;only advise classes that match
&#8230;&quot;, etc. Caveat Emptor!
</p>
<p>
For 18090, a bug prevented JoinPoint#invoke_original_join_point (which
allows you to bypass all advices at the join point) from working except for
:around advice (and yes, the specs didn&#8216;t cover this adequately -
gasp!). Now fixed.
</p>
<p>
For 17881, I created a separate set of specs for JRuby, so it&#8216;s
easier to run the &quot;regular&quot; <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> specs using MRI and the
JRuby-specific specs separately with JRuby. The new &quot;jruby&quot;
directory contains a Rakefile, another set of specs, and Java example code
for the specs to use. The default Rakefile task re-runs the main <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> spec suite using JRuby, to
confirm that the suite passes successfully, then it runs a set of different
specs that load sample Java interfaces and classes into JRuby and then
advises them with <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>.
</p>
<p>
I found a few JRuby bugs and other behavior differences between MRI during
this release. I was able to handle them with modifications to the <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> code. If you &quot;grep&quot;
the <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> &quot;lib&quot; and
&quot;spec&quot; directories for the word &quot;jruby&quot; (ignoring
case), you&#8216;ll find notes about these issues and the workarounds I
implemented.
</p>
<p>
The separate JRuby spec suite shows what you can and cannot do with Java
types. As a side benefit, it also demonstrates how Java types, objects, and
methods are mapped to Ruby. There are some important limitations, however.
See the jruby.html page on the website or the README for more details.
</p>
<p>
Note: JRuby 1.1RC2 was used.
</p>
<h2>Version 0.3.1</h2>
<p>
V0.3.1 adds numerous performance improvements, especially in the RSpec
suite, and some minor API additions.
</p>
<p>
Bug fixes: N.A.
</p>
<p>
Enhancements: 14447 Unify internal handling of reporting errors to the user
17514 Provide an <a href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a>
library-wide logger with configuration parameters and instance overrides
17515 Add an optional warning if an aspect doesn&#8216;t match any join
points 17516 Remove unnecessary examples that use :types_and_descendents to
shorten time to run the RSpec suite 17565 JoinPoint.new should convert a
type name, symbol, or regex to the type and only allow one type
</p>
<p>
These first two enhancements are related. There is a now an <a
href="../classes/Aquarium/Utils/DefaultLogger.html">Aquarium::Utils::DefaultLogger</a>
module with static accessors for getting and setting the
&quot;system-wide&quot; logger.
</p>
<p>
When instance-level overrides are necessary, the <a
href="../classes/Aquarium/Utils/OptionsUtils.html">Aquarium::Utils::OptionsUtils</a>
provides &quot;universal&quot; options (but currently used only by Aspect
and Pointcut) for specifying a logger (with the new :logger parameter), or
alternatively, specifying just the output stream (:logger_stream) and/or
the severity (:severity, one of the standard library&#8216;s
Logger::Severity-defined constants). If either of the latter two options is
specified, a separate logger instance is created, rather than changing
parameters for the global logger.
</p>
<p>
OptionsUtils also supports a :noop parameter, which classes interpret to
mean do none (or perhaps only some) of the processing. Useful for
debugging.
</p>
<p>
17515 adds a helpful warning to the system (or aspect-instance&#8216;s)
logger if an aspect matches no join points. This warning will be suppressed
if (i) the severity level for the logger is above WARN or (ii) the aspect
was created with the option
</p>
<pre>
        :ignore_no_matching_join_points =&gt; true.
</pre>
<p>
17516 fixes halved the long execution times for the whole RSpec suite by
refactoring some examples that used type finders with the
:types_and_descendents option unnecessarily. It is a very intensive
computation! Note that I stubbed out these calls using an aspect with
around advise, a useful &quot;development-time&quot; aspect. See
Aquarium::TypeUtilsStub (in spec_example_types.rb) and how it&#8216;s used
in pointcut_spec.rb. Using this technique and other optimizations, the time
to run the suite was reduced from ~5 minutes to about 1 minute.
</p>
<p>
17565 fixes a &quot;hole&quot; in JoinPoint, where it doesn&#8216;t confirm
that a specified type string, symbol or regex matches a class that exists
and only one class. Now it does and it stores the type, rather than the
original &quot;specification&quot; for it.
</p>
<h2>Version 0.3.0</h2>
<p>
V0.3.0 adds numerous improvements to the DSL, making aspect specification
more intuitive and English-like. For example, where you previously wrote,
e.g.,
</p>
<pre>
        around :methods =&gt; :all, :types =&gt; [Foo, Bar], :advice =&gt; advice_proc
        after  :attribute =&gt; name, :attribute_options =&gt; [:readers], :objects =&gt; [foo, bar] ...
</pre>
<p>
Now you can write the same aspects as follows:
</p>
<pre>
        around :calls_to =&gt; :all_methods, :within_types =&gt; [Foo, Bar], :use_advice =&gt; advice_proc
        after  :reading =&gt; name, :on_objects =&gt; [foo, bar] ...
</pre>
<p>
Other improvements include performance and robustness enhancements and
miscellaneous internal refactoring and DRY improvements.
</p>
<p>
Bug fixes: 16267 gem not updating
</p>
<p>
Enhancements: 17154 More intuitive synonyms for specifying types, methods
and attributes
</p>
<p>
For 17154, the following changes were made: Added :all_methods as a synonym
for the :all special value. Added :reading as a synonym for :attributes
=&gt; &#8230;, :attribute_options =&gt; [:readers] Added :writing and
:changing as synonyms for :attributes =&gt; &#8230;, :attribute_options
=&gt; [:writers] Added :accessing as a synonym for :attributes =&gt;
&#8230; Added :calls_to, :calling, :invoking, :sending_message_to as
synonyms for :methods. Added :on_types, :in_types, :within_types and
:for_types as synonyms for :types. The same set of prefixes is supported
for :type, :objects, :object, and the various :exclude_*, :*_and_ancestors,
and :*_and_descendents.
</p>
<p>
The full list of possible synonyms are shown in the spec examples. In
particular, see &quot;pointcut_spec.rb&quot;.
</p>
<h2>Version 0.2.0</h2>
<p>
V0.2.0 changes the parameter list used for advice blocks and adds numerous
enhancements, robustness improvements and more complete
&quot;spec&#8216;ing&quot;.
</p>
<p>
Bug fixes: none
</p>
<p>
Enhancements: 13402 Support a subclass syntax like AspectJ&#8216;s
&quot;Type+&quot; 13984 More flexible argument list to the advise block
14053 Remove JoinPoint#type, JoinPoint#type=, JoinPoint#object, and
JoinPoint#object= 14061 Add a control flow mechanism to skipping (sic)
intermediate advice 15164 Deprecate ObjectFinder 15413 Remove ObjectFinder
15710 Eliminate redundant public methods in various &quot;finders&quot;
</p>
<p>
13402 adds new invocation options to specify types and their descendents
(subclasses or modules that include the specified module(s)) and ancestors.
The latter should be used cautiously as it will include things like Kernel,
<a href="../classes/Object.html">Object</a>, and Class! I used new command
options rather than the AspectJ &quot;+&quot; suffix (and the proposed, but
never implemented &quot;-&quot; suffix for ancestors), because the
&quot;+&quot; would be confusing with regular expressions and not in the
spirit of trying to make the pointcut language &quot;easy to read&quot;.
So, the following are now available:
</p>
<pre>
  :type_and_ancestors
  :types_and_ancestors
  :type_and_descendents
  :types_and_descendents
</pre>
<p>
And the corresponding:
</p>
<pre>
  :exclude_type_and_ancestors
  :exclude_types_and_ancestors
  :exclude_type_and_descendents
  :exclude_types_and_descendents
</pre>
<p>
If you want both the ancestors and descendents, just use both options with
the same value.
</p>
<p>
13984 adds the object as the second argument to the advice block parameter
list. This change reflects the fact that the object is often needed, but
calling jp.context.advised_object is a bit tedious. THIS CHANGE BREAKS
BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY!! An exception is raised if advice has the
signature |jp, *args|.
</p>
<p>
14061 adds a new method, JoinPoint#invoke_original_join_point, which will
invoke the original method without intermediate advice. If called within
around advice, you can write advice that vetoes all subsequent advice, yet
invokes the original method. Use this technique cautiously, however, since
you may not always know what other advices are involved and what side
effects this control-flow change might cause.
</p>
<p>
15164 and 15413 remove ObjectFinder because it is not used and it requires
ObjectSpace, which has high overhead and won&#8216;t be enabled, by
default, in JRuby (it will be optional).
</p>
<p>
15710 removes redundant methods that were becoming a maintenance issue, in
particular, MethodFinder#find_all_by and TypeFinder#find_by_name. This is a
non-backwards-compatible API change.
</p>
<p>
Finally, note that I have not yet been able to resolve bug 15202,
&quot;Intermittent confusion between classes and objects when invoking
advice.&quot; I believe this is a very rare occurrence and only likely to
ever happen during the &quot;torture-test&quot; of running the RSpec suite.
Please post a comment to Tracker if you encounter it!
</p>
<h2>Version 0.1.8</h2>
<p>
V0.1.7 did not successfully &quot;register&quot; at rubyforge. This
releases fixes that problem and also adds several feature enhancements and
refactorings. There are no known upgrade issues.
</p>
<p>
Bug fixes: none
</p>
<p>
Enhancements: 13399 Add :exclusion options for methods and types. 14707
:exclude_ancestor_methods as synonym for :suppress_ancestor_methods
</p>
<p>
13399 adds new
:exclude_(pointcuts|join_points|types|objects|methods|attributes) options
for Aspect.new, and Pointcut.new that make it easier to specify a list or
regular expression for various &quot;items&quot; and then to exclude
particular items, e.g.,
</p>
<pre>
        Aspect.new :around, :types =&gt; /nterestingType/, :exclude_types =&gt; UninterestingType ...
</pre>
<p>
The :exclude_ancestor_methods option is now preferred over
:suppress_ancestor_methods, since the former is more consistent with the
new :exclude_* options.
</p>
<h2>Version 0.1.7</h2>
<p>
Bug fixes: 14946 Advice fails when instrumenting methods containing special
characters 15038 Spec for pointcut example variation 1 15039 Spec for
pointcut example variation 2 15085 Specifying just :attributes for aspects
also matches all methods, as if :methods =&amp;gt; :all specified
</p>
<p>
Enhancements: 13396 Unify internal handling of types vs. objects
</p>
<p>
15038 and 15039 were bugs in one of the examples (actually in the
comments). However, experimenting with them also revealed the nasty 15085
bug!
</p>
<p>
I previously handled some special characters in method names, but not all
the possible ones, hence 14946. <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> should now properly handle any
valid Ruby method name.
</p>
<h2>Version 0.1.6</h2>
<p>
Bug fixes: 14353 Advising subclass method that calls super raises exception
when method executed 14356 Regexps for types must cover the whole name,
which is inconsistent with method/attribute regexps 14384 Design by
Contract &quot;extra&quot; does not return correct value &quot;invar&quot;
handling 13410 Fix funky navigation bar on website
</p>
<p>
14353 was kind of bad, but it&#8216;s actually a Ruby bug with a good
workaround. If you advised a method that called &quot;super&quot;, Ruby
would use the wrong method name to lookup the class in the parent. See the
bug description for the details.
</p>
<p>
For 14356, type regular expressions now match on parts of names; they
don&#8216;t have to match the whole name. The exception is regular
expressions with module separators &quot;::&quot;. In this case, it seems
to make more sense for the regular expression to be interpreted as follows:
If the expression is /A::B::C::D/, then for the the outermost types, the
expression behaves as /^.*A/, for the types between two &quot;::&quot;, the
expressions behave as /^B$/ and /^C$/, and the trailing expression behaves
as /D.*$/.
</p>
<p>
14384 was an easy mistake to make with &quot;around&quot; advice; you have
to remember to return the result of the &quot;join_point.proceed&quot;
call, unless you specifically want to change the returned value! Here are
two ways to do it:
</p>
<pre>
        do_something_before(...)
        result = join_point.proceed
        do_something_after(...)
        return result
</pre>
<p>
or
</p>
<pre>
        begin
                do_something_before(...)
                join_point.proceed
        ensure
                do_something_after(...)
        end
</pre>
<p>
The latter approach looks &quot;asymmetrical&quot; and it will behave
differently if &quot;proceed&quot; raises! However, it eliminates the
temporary, if you find that desirable.
</p>
<p>
Enhancements: 13407 Pick a better method name for JoinPoint#type, which
hides the Module#type 14385 Pointcut.new should accept a :join_point =&gt;
jp argument 14386 Aspect.new &#8230;, :pointcut =&gt; should accept a join
point object 14440 Add good warning message when &quot;proceed&quot; used
for non-around advice
</p>
<p>
For 13407, new attribute methods have been added
</p>
<ul>
<li>JoinPoint#target_type return the type that the join_point matches.

</li>
<li>JoinPoint#target_type= set the type that the join_point matches.

</li>
<li>JoinPoint#target_object return the object that the join_point matches.

</li>
<li>JoinPoint#target_object= set the object that the join_point matches.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following, older methods are now deprecated and will be removed in the
0.2.0 release (14053):
</p>
<ul>
<li>JoinPoint#type

</li>
<li>JoinPoint#type=

</li>
<li>JoinPoint#object

</li>
<li>JoinPoint#object=

</li>
</ul>
<p>
JoinPoint#type method is deprecated because it hides Module#type, which
returns the type of the corresponding object. For &quot;symmetry&quot;, the
other three methods are also now deprecated and they will be removed in a
future release. Until then, all will print a warning message to STDOUT. (If
you really want the type of what could be a JoinPoint object, you should
use class anyway, as Module#type is also deprecated!)
</p>
<h2>Version 0.1.5</h2>
<p>
Bug fixes: 13514 Protected and private methods are made public when advised
and left that way when unadvised 13650 Loading <a
href="../classes/Aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> interferes with Rails filters
13864 Bug with negative object_id
</p>
<p>
Enhancements: 13392 Convert examples to specs. 13463 Support running in
JRuby
</p>
<p>
Fixing 13650 required an API change, which is why I&#8216;ve tagged this
release &quot;0.1.5&quot; instead of something like &quot;0.1.1&quot; (and
the changes don&#8216;t seem big enough to warrant
&quot;0.2.0&quot;&#8230;).
</p>
<p>
Previously, requiring &quot;aquarium.rb&quot; in the top-level
&quot;lib&quot; directory would implicitly require
lib/aquarium/aspects/dsl/aspect_dsl.rb, which has <a
href="../classes/Object.html">Object</a> include the AspectDSL module. This
module adds methods like :before and :after to <a
href="../classes/Object.html">Object</a>. Unfortunately, those methods
collide with methods of the same name that Rails adds to <a
href="../classes/Object.html">Object</a>. It was also a bit presumptuous of
me to assume that everyone wanted those methods on <a
href="../classes/Object.html">Object</a> ;)
</p>
<p>
In this release, aspect_dsl.rb is still implicitly included and it still
defines the AspectDSL module. Now, however, it does not include the
AspectDSL module in <a href="../classes/Object.html">Object</a>. Instead,
if you want this behavior for all types, you must require the new
lib/aquarium/aspects/dsl/object_dsl.rb explicitly.
</p>
<p>
As an alternative, if you just want the AspectDSL module included
selectively in certain types, then do the following:
</p>
<pre>
        class MyClass   # reopen &quot;MyClass&quot;
                # Add the methods as _class_ methods
                include Aquarium::Aspects::DSL::AspectDSL
        end
</pre>
<p>
or, use (class|module)_eval:
</p>
<pre>
        require 'aquarium/aspects/dsl/aspect_dsl'

        MyClass.class_eval do
                # Add the methods as _class_ methods
                include Aquarium::Aspects::DSL::AspectDSL
        end
</pre>
<p>
To add the methods as <em>instance</em> methods on individual objects:
</p>
<pre>
        object = MyClass.new
        object.extend(Aquarium::Aspects::DSL::AspectDSL)
</pre>
<p>
Note: as discussed at <a
href="http://practicalruby.blogspot.com/2007/02/reopen-with-moduleeval.html">practicalruby.blogspot.com/2007/02/reopen-with-moduleeval.html</a>,
using &quot;class_eval&quot; or &quot;module_eval&quot; is safer that just
reopening a class if you&#8216;re not sure that &quot;MyClass&quot; has
actually been defined yet. However, in our particular case, it probably
doesn&#8216;t matter, as AspectDSL doesn&#8216;t change anything about the
type, like aliasing existing methods. Still, we can&#8216;t guarantee that
this won&#8216;t change in the future.
